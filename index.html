					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have too many problems when completing this lab. I was struggling with organising the files and folders at first, but I eventually I got it to look like the past labs. One thing I did notice was that I have to type my name twice which when I talked to others they were having the same issue. I talked to my partner and I was able to fix it. I just had to delete one part in the header because the script file was being called twice. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Overall, I think this lab turned out well. I used some CSS to make the interactive part be the main thing you notice when you open the page. Other than being able to talk to my partner, I was also able to get some help from people in my section.</p>
